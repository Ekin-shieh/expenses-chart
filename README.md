- Understand the actual effects and usage scenario differences between flex and grid in scenarios such as centering and equal spacing.
- Master how to use absolute positioning and transparency to display a tooltip when hovering.

### Continued development

- Add animation transition effect when the column appears.
- Add automatic date judgment for the dynamic highlight color of the current date.
- Use a more modern and standardized way to organize style and script files.
